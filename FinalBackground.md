# Analysis of Delaware State Employee Credit Card Transactions

## Problem
State-backed credit card programs are extremely benefical for expediting the process of getting State Agencies the materials they need to operate. However, in exhange for this increase in speed, purchases often lose significant oversight. This can lead to substantial misuse of tax payer money through state employees using government credit cards for personal items.
## Background
The State of Delaware PCard Program allows for State employees to make purchases using credit cards backed by the State of Delaware and subsequently Delaware Taxpayers. In order to increase the efficency of getting neccesary purches for State agencies, prior approval is not required for employees to use the credit cards. All though the purchase sums are typically small in size, this process still consists of a non-elected offical using taxpayer money without direct approval. Just like any form of government spending, employee credit card spending deserves to be evaluated and criticed by the public. 

## Research Questions
* What is the breakdown of spending per Department?
* What are the most common uses of the credit card?
* What is the statistical analysis of Purchase prices?
* Are the current procedures put in place enough to prevent misuse?

## Justification 
**What is the breakdown of spending per Department**  
Breaking the total spending of the government cards allows for a better analysis of what governemnt angencies are spending the most/least. Further examing the purches of the most used Agencies will help to form a better informed opinon on if the uses are justified.

**What are the most common uses of the credit card**  
Establishing pattern of common uses will make identifiy unqiue or out of places purchases easier to identify from the overall population. 

**What is the statistical analysis of Purchase prices**

**Are the current procedures put in place enought to preven misue**
This question represents the overall goal of this analysis. By answers the previous questions above, I hope to combine the information into this final question speaking to the heart of the issue.

## Datasets

## Ethical Concerns
State credit card fraud is a federal offensive punisable with hefty fines and prison time. It is extremely important that throughout this analysis that no harsh accusations are made.
